## 🤖 Setting up Claude

If you haven't setup MCP before, [first read more about how to install Claude Desktop client & configure an MCP server.](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

To add `paprika-3-mcp` to Claude, all you need to do is create another entry in the `mcpServers` section of your `claude_desktop_config.json` file.

### Option 1: macOS Keychain (recommended — no credentials in config)

Store your password in the macOS Keychain once:

```bash
security add-generic-password -s paprika-3-mcp -a your@email.com -w
```

Then configure Claude with only your username in the environment — no password in the file at all:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paprika-3": {
      "command": "paprika-3-mcp",
      "env": {
        "PAPRIKA_USERNAME": "your@email.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

At startup the server looks up the password from the Keychain automatically using the username as the account key.

### Option 2: Environment variables

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paprika-3": {
      "command": "paprika-3-mcp",
      "env": {
        "PAPRIKA_USERNAME": "your@email.com",
        "PAPRIKA_PASSWORD": "your-password"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: CLI flags (least preferred — credentials visible in process list)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paprika-3": {
      "command": "paprika-3-mcp",
      "args": [
        "--username",
        "<your paprika 3 username (usually email)>",
        "--password",
        "<your paprika 3 password>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude and you should see the MCP server tools after clicking on the hammerhead icon:

#### 🗂 Miscellaneous

##### 📄 Where can I see the server logs?

The MCP server writes structured logs using Go’s `slog` with rotation via `lumberjack`. Log files are automatically created based on your operating system:

| Operating System | Log File Path                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| macOS            | `~/Library/Logs/paprika-3-mcp/server.log` |
| Linux            | `/var/log/paprika-3-mcp/server.log`       |
| Windows          | `%APPDATA%\paprika-3-mcp\server.log`      |
| Other / Unknown  | `/tmp/paprika-3-mcp/server.log`           |

> 💡 Logs are rotated automatically at 100MB, with only 5 backup files kept. Logs are also wiped after 10 days.
